## Approach taken to build app

1. I used an application called MedlyText to make a master list of all the things I need to do for my project. The app allows you to create a journal and add notes inside them with easy buttons at the top to do things like; make a To Do list, Ordered/Unordered list, embed active codeblocks, add headers (H1, H2 and H3).

I created a journal for the project and named my first note  "P0 - Project 2 Plan". This note is like my table of contents that has all the steps in chronological order including more specific goals within them.

I then took each numbered bullet and created a note for each one. This is a helpful visual for me and helps me break down each step into smaller goals.
